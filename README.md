# UART Transmission with Ring Buffer on STM32

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a circular buffer for UART transmission on an STM32 microcontroller (STM32F103C8) using bare-metal programming in Keil MDK. This implementation aims to provide an efficient method for managing UART data transmission by buffering outgoing data, allowing for non-blocking communication.
